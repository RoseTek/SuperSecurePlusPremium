# SuperSecurePlusPremium (Univeristy Project - POC)

This is the code of an Android application used in our university project.

The goal of this code is to provide a PoC of an Android phishing attack without any effort to make this code clean or reusable as the application was not the main part of the project and was not thouroughly designed beforehand.

Most of the classes are ours, especially those related to data extraction and communication using web requests. The Payload class is taken from [a public repo](https://github.com/giovannicolonna/msfvenom-backdoor-android) made by [Giovanni Colonna](https://github.com/giovannicolonna)
